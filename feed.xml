We are working to build a world with greater access to global commerce and more opportunities for people everywhere to build the lives they want. We believe this is made possible with decentralized money like Bitcoin and decentralized marketplaces like OpenBazaar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a big vision. Much of the work we are doing right now is largely untangling some of the technological and psychological knots the infrastructure and assumptions of the last 20 years have made for us all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the first and biggest knots we knew had to be untangled for a decentralized marketplace like OpenBazaar to be feasible was a pretty basic service other marketplaces and storefronts have historically provided: dispute resolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think about it: in a decentralized network that’s made only of the individual people that participate in it, and transactions exist only between the people engaged in them, what happens when something goes wrong with an order?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Payments in OpenBazaar&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a bit of background, OpenBazaar currently uses 3 different cryptocurrency payment types:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Direct
Offline
Moderated
Generally, if a buyer trusts a seller they can just send their coins directly to them in a direct payment. If the seller is offline at the time of payment, that creates a slightly different payment type where they just have to claim their coins when they return to their store. (You can read more details about each of these payment types here.)&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Decentralizing ecommerce is an important part of the future we believe in.

For those who are just learning about what we are doing, this new version is a major update from our previous release. There are many significant improvements that make OpenBazaar the most secure, private, and liberating trade platform online. In preparation of the full OpenBazaar 2.0 launch later this month we're now highlighting several of the major new features you can look forward to using. If you're feeling adventurous you can test the beta yourself, or wait to use OpenBazaar when the release is ready. To be notified when the beta is live, please [sign up for our newsletter](http://ob1.us14.list-manage1.com/subscribe?u=ebb5d4d5a336e9beebdc36911&id=66c0aaaa42).   ![](https://www.openbazaar.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/OpenBazaar-2.0-Search-Experience-1024x663.png)   Get ready for major improvements when searching for listings in OpenBazaar 2.0! We went back to the drawing board and recreated the search experience from the ground up. When OpenBazaar 1.0 launched in April 2016, 3rd party developers identified the challenges around building a truly decentralized search experience and proceeded to build centralized services that crawl and curate listings across many stores on the network. [BazaarBay](http://bazaarbay.org/) launched the first search engine built specifically for the OpenBazaar platform. [DuoSearch](https://duosear.ch/) and [Mubiz](https://mubiz.com/) followed shortly after. When re-thinking search in OpenBazaar 2.0, instead of re-creating another less than ideal experience, we were strongly in favor of optimizing for the best possible user experience. Utilizing 3rd party search engines would deliver the best user experience while also helping the 3rd party ecosystem grow around OpenBazaar. This results in: faster load times, better curation, shop by category, customized search filtering, improved spam prevention, better sorting, fuzzy search and much more. **Here’s a sneak preview of the UI:**   ![](https://gifyu.com/images/openbazaar-2.0-discover-experience.gif)   Notice how easy it is to toggle between search engines. Each search engine ranks listings differently and provide a unique set of search filters. When shopping on eCommerce platforms such as Amazon or eBay, we’re forced to use their built in search engine, which may be artificially ranking their internal brands or highest paying partners higher than independent sellers. In OpenBazaar, we avoid the favoritism issues by supporting a rich ecosystem of search providers. This just scratches the surface of what is capable with search in OpenBazaar 2.0. We hope to see many more search engines spin up in the near future! In the next search related post, we'll dive under the hood and explain how to create and layer in your own search engine into OpenBazaar. Stay tuned! **\- Mike Wolf**, UX / Design lead \[/et\_pb\_text\]\[et\_pb\_code admin\_label="Social (ALL)" \_builder\_version="3.0.66" custom\_css\_main\_element="margin: auto;" max\_width="800px" disabled="off" disabled\_on="off|off|" saved\_tabs="all"\]<div width="100%" style="margin: 0 auto !important;"><!-- \[et\_pb\_line\_break\_holder\] --><!-- \[et\_pb\_line\_break\_holder\] --><div class="a2a\_kit a2a\_kit\_size\_32 a2a\_default\_style"><!-- \[et\_pb\_line\_break\_holder\] --> <a class="a2a\_button\_tumblr"></a><!-- \[et\_pb\_line\_break\_holder\] --> <a class="a2a\_button\_facebook"></a><!-- \[et\_pb\_line\_break\_holder\] --> <a class="a2a\_button\_twitter"></a><!-- \[et\_pb\_line\_break\_holder\] --> <a class="a2a\_dd" href="https://www.addtoany.com/share"></a><!-- \[et\_pb\_line\_break\_holder\] --></div><!-- \[et\_pb\_line\_break\_holder\] --><!-- \[et\_pb\_line\_break\_holder\] --><script async src="https://static.addtoany.com/menu/page.js"></script><!-- \[et\_pb\_line\_break\_holder\] --><!-- \[et\_pb\_line\_break\_holder\] --></div>\[/et\_pb\_code\]\[/et\_pb\_column\]\[/et\_pb\_row\]\[et\_pb\_row use\_custom\_width="on" width\_unit="off" custom\_width\_percent="100%" custom\_padding="|10%||10%" padding\_mobile="off" background\_color="#f2f2f2" column\_padding\_mobile="on" background\_color\_1="#f2f2f2" parallax\_method\_1="off" parallax\_method\_2="off" parallax\_method\_3="off" parallax\_method\_4="off" disabled\_on="off|off|" custom\_css\_main\_element="border-top: solid 1px #ccc;||border-bottom: solid 1px #ccc;" background\_position="top\_left" background\_repeat="repeat" background\_size="initial" \_builder\_version="3.0.53" background\_position\_1="top\_left" background\_repeat\_1="no-repeat" disabled="off"\]\[et\_pb\_column type="4\_4"\]\[et\_pb\_text admin\_label="Medium Links (Desktop)" max\_width="1000px" disabled\_on="on|on|" custom\_css\_main\_element="margin: auto;" background\_position="top\_left" background\_repeat="repeat" background\_size="initial" \_builder\_version="3.0.53" background\_layout="light" text\_orientation="left" border_style="solid" disabled="off"\]

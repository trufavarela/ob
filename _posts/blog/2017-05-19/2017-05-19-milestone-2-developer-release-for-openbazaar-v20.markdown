\[et\_pb\_section bb\_built="1"\]\[et\_pb\_row\]\[et\_pb\_column type="4\_4"\]\[et\_pb\_text\] Development of the OpenBazaar 2.0 software continues according to [our roadmap](https://trello.com/b/dF6ymHGU/openbazaar-high-level-roadmap), and today we publish the [Milestone 2 developer release](https://github.com/OpenBazaar/openbazaar-desktop/releases/tag/v2.0.4). Please note that this release is not yet feature complete, and cannot be used for real transactions yet. Milestone 2 focuses on discoverability of listings / stores, as well as communication. Third party search is now accessible within the client. Chat is also fully functional. Channels were planned for Milestone 2, but have been moved to later in development. Full release notes below.   [![Search in v2 client](https://blog.openbazaar.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Screenshot-from-2017-05-19-15-18-03-1024x648.png)](https://blog.openbazaar.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Screenshot-from-2017-05-19-15-18-03.png)

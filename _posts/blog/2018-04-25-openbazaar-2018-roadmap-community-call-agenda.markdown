We are looking forward to seeing you this Thursday, April 26th at 11am EST to discuss the 2018 development roadmap and determine some priorities together as a community! Since we are expecting quite a few attendees, we want to share a brief agenda so everyone knows what to expect and we can keep things sane(ish!)

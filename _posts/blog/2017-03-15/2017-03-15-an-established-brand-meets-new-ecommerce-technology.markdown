In this post we are exploring a store that boasts a brand you may already know called BMW. Yes, like the cars! But no, while cars _could_ be sold through OpenBazaar, they aren't here at the moment, but you can get some great promotional items available in **BMW M Power Store.** You can check it out [in your browser ](https://duosear.ch/@bmwmpower)or on OpenBazaar [here](ob://3c5752ac73b1075112b09d969851bd5c93a52b9f). _The owner of this store is choosing to remain anonymous but still took the time to share about their experience and what's motivated them to sell on OpenBazaar!_ **Tell us a bit about yourself. Who are you and what do you make/sell?** I live in Munich, Germany but originally I was born in Bulgaria. I own a BMW sports car and I am a big fan of the brand. I work in a branch of BMW Group in Munich and use OpenBazaar to promote the brand as well. **How familiar are you with Bitcoin?** I believe Bitcoin is the invention of our generation and is the next big thing after the Internet.I am not a tech guy so I don't have much to say about development but I do support this technology as much as I can. I use it as payment when possible, just some small transactions in order to show my support, and I use to trade it against some alts in an exchange. I am not very familiar with trading so I don't do this much, though. Most of all, I am person who doesn't support the power of governments and banks over people so any chance I have in life to disrupt the System I embrace with love :) Peer 2 Peer trading and for sure Bitcoin are two things that allow me to do this in a practical way. **How did you find out about OpenBazaar?** I first read about it on Twitter and thought I'd give a shot! **Why are you selling your product on OpenBazaar?** I use Bitcoin in my daily life, I am a fan of BMW, and I support the anti-bank and agorism movements. Those 3 things combine perfectly in OpenBazaar! **How has your experience been with OpenBazaar so far?** I don't earn anything for myself by selling the BMW items that I do in OpenBazaar, I just do it for the pleasure of promoting the brand and promoting the use of Bitcoin. The OB community is very wise and so far any small issues that I have had are resolved quickly and easy by the members in Slack! OB1 Co-Founder Dr. Washington Sanchez has also helped me a lot running my nodes and I really appreciate the personal care.
